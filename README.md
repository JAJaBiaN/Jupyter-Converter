# Jupyter-Converter
A program for converting Jupyter notebooks into python scripts.
All code and markdown are written to an executable python script.

There are two versions:
- One is a Jupyter notebook, for those who use them but are trying to be considerate to their colleagues who don't.
- One is a python (.py) script, for those whose colleagues aren't so considerate.

Notes:
- This program is designed to create executable python files. It is not designed to maintain the readability of a Jupyter notebook. Thus, this program will not write outputs into the .py file in any way.
